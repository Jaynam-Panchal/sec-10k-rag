  "Item 1A - Risk Factors": "Item\u00a01A of Part I, \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position.\nThe sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, economic conditions and actions by policymaking bodies are contributing to changing interest rates and significant capital market volatility, which, along with any increases in our borrowing levels, could increase our future borrowing costs.\n23\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See",
  "Item 8 - Financial Statements": "Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \u2014 Note 10 \u2014 Segment Information.\u201d\nOverview\nMacroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased interest rates, significant capital market and supply chain volatility, and global economic and geopolitical developments, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations that are difficult to isolate and quantify. In addition, changes in fuel, utility, and food costs, interest rates, and economic outlook may impact customer demand and our ability to forecast consumer spending patterns. We also expect the current macroeconomic environment and enterprise customer cost optimization efforts to impact our AWS revenue growth rates. We expect some or all of these factors to continue to impact our operations into Q1 2024.\nNet Sales\nNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees, AWS sales, advertising services, Amazon Prime membership fees, and certain digital media content subscriptions. Net sales information is as follows (in millions):\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYear Ended December 31,\n\u00a0\n2022\n2023\nNet Sales:\nNorth America\n$\n315,880\u00a0\n$\n352,828\u00a0\nInternational\n118,007\u00a0\n131,200\u00a0\nAWS\n80,096\u00a0\n90,757\u00a0\nConsolidated\n$\n513,983\u00a0\n$\n574,785\u00a0\nYear-over-year Percentage Growth (Decline):\nNorth America\n13\u00a0\n%\n12\u00a0\n%\nInternational\n(8)\n11\u00a0\nAWS\n29\u00a0\n13\u00a0\nConsolidated\n9\u00a0\n12\u00a0\nYear-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates:\nNorth America\n13\u00a0\n%\n12\u00a0\n%\nInternational\n4\u00a0\n11\u00a0\nAWS\n29\u00a0\n13\u00a0\nConsolidated\n13\u00a0\n12\u00a0\nNet Sales Mix:\nNorth America\n61\u00a0\n%\n61\u00a0\n%\nInternational\n23\u00a0\n23\u00a0\nAWS\n16\u00a0\n16\u00a0\nConsolidated\n100\u00a0\n%\n100\u00a0\n%\nSales increased 12% in 2023, compared to the prior year. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced net sales by $71\u00a0million in 2023. For a discussion of the effect of foreign exchange rates on sales growth, see \u201cEffect of Foreign Exchange Rates\u201d below.\nNorth America sales increased 12% in 2023, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, primarily by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and subscription services. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued focus on price, selection, and convenience for our customers, including from our shipping offers.\nInternational sales increased 11% in 2023, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, primarily by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and subscription services. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued focus on price, selection, and convenience for our customers, including from our shipping offers. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased International net sales by $88\u00a0million in 2023.\n24\nTable of Contents\nAWS sales increased 13% in 2023, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes, primarily driven by long-term customer contracts.\nOperating Income (Loss)\nOperating income (loss) by segment is as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022\n2023\nOperating Income (Loss)\nNorth America\n$\n(2,847)\n$\n14,877\u00a0\nInternational\n(7,746)\n(2,656)\nAWS\n22,841\u00a0\n24,631\u00a0\nConsolidated\n$\n12,248\u00a0\n$\n36,852\u00a0\nOperating income was $12.2 billion and $36.9 billion for 2022 and 2023. We believe that operating income is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services.\nThe North America operating income in 2023, as compared to the operating loss in the prior year, is primarily due to increased unit sales and increased advertising sales, partially offset by increased shipping and fulfillment costs and increased technology and infrastructure costs.\nThe decrease in International operating loss in absolute dollars in 2023, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased unit sales and increased advertising sales, partially offset by increased fulfillment and shipping costs and increased technology and infrastructure costs. Changes in foreign exchange rates positively impacted operating loss by $246\u00a0million in 2023.\nThe increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2023, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased sales, partially offset by increased payroll and related expenses and spending on technology infrastructure, both of which were primarily driven by additional investments to support AWS business growth. Changes in foreign exchange rates positively impacted operating income by $220\u00a0million in 2023.\n25\nTable of Contents\nOperating Expenses\nInformation about operating expenses is as follows (in millions):\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYear Ended December 31,\n\u00a0\u00a0\n2022\n2023\nOperating Expenses:\nCost of sales\n$\n288,831\u00a0\n$\n304,739\u00a0\nFulfillment\n84,299\u00a0\n90,619\u00a0\nTechnology and infrastructure\n73,213\u00a0\n85,622\u00a0\nSales and marketing\n42,238\u00a0\n44,370\u00a0\nGeneral and administrative",

  "Item 7 - MD&A": "Item 7 of Part II, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see",
