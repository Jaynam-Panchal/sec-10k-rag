The Company\u2019s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company\u2019s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company\u2019s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.\nMarkets and Distribution\nThe Company\u2019s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2024, the Company\u2019s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 38% and 62%, respectively, of total net sales.\nCompetition\nThe markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on its intellectual property.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 2\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company\u2019s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company\u2019s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company\u2019s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company\u2019s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 3\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company\u2019s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company believes that its people play an important role in its success, and strives to attract, develop and retain the best talent. The Company works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members, so that its people can do the best work of their lives. As of September\u00a028, 2024, the Company had approximately 164,000 full-time equivalent employees.\nCompensation and Benefits\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company\u2019s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world, including health, wellness and time away.\nGrowth and Development\nThe Company invests in resources to help its people develop and achieve their career goals. The Company offers programs through Apple University on leadership, management and influence, as well as Apple culture and values. Team members can also take advantage of online classes for business, technical and personal development, as well as learning opportunities to support their well-being.\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination.\nInclusion and Diversity\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.\nEngagement\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\nHealth and Safety\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates.

  "Item 3 - Legal Proceedings": "Item 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Legal Proceedings\nDigital Markets Act Investigations\nOn March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance investigations against the Company under the DMA. The Commission\u2019s investigations concern (1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to default settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced its preliminary findings in the Article 5(4) investigation alleging that the Company\u2019s App Store rules are in breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a third formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the Company\u2019s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA. If the Commission makes a final determination that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company\u2019s annual worldwide net sales. Although any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the General Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the Commission\u2019s order would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, unless a stay of the order is granted. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for \u201cperformance smartphones\u201d and \u201csmartphones\u201d in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition,\nvarious civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S.\n alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. (\u201cEpic\u201d) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the \u201cCalifornia District Court\u201d) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California\u2019s unfair competition law based upon the Company\u2019s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company\u2019s App Store Review Guidelines violate California\u2019s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. A motion by Epic disputing the Company\u2019s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the Company has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a motion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate the injunction. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2024 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.",
  "Item 7A - Market Risk": "Item 7A.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company\u2019s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate\u2013sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any associated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September\u00a028, 2024 and September\u00a030, 2023 (dollars in millions):\nInterest Rate\nSensitive Instrument\nHypothetical Interest\nRate Increase\nPotential Impact\n2024\n2023\nInvestment portfolio\n100 basis points, all tenors\nDecline in fair value\n$\n2,755\u00a0\n$\n3,089\u00a0\nTerm debt\n100 basis points, all tenors\nIncrease in annual interest expense\n$\n139\u00a0\n$\n194\u00a0\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\u2019s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $538 million and $669 million as of September\u00a028, 2024 and September\u00a030, 2023, respectively. Changes in the Company\u2019s underlying foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivatives.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 27"
