Our products are sold in about 180 countries and territories throughout the world. The Company was incorporated in Ohio in 1905, having first been established as a New Jersey corporation in 1890, and was built from a business founded in Cincinnati in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble.\nAdditional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A); and Notes 1 and 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms \"Company,\" \"P&G,\" \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us\" as used herein refer to The Procter\u00a0& Gamble Company (the registrant) and its subsidiaries. Throughout this Form 10-K, we incorporate by reference information from other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nThe Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments thereto, are filed electronically with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains these reports at: www.sec.gov. Reports can also be accessed and downloaded through links from our website at: www.pginvestor.com.

Copies of these reports are also available, without charge, by contacting EQ Shareowner Services, 1100 Centre Pointe Curve, Suite 101, Mendota, MN 55120-4100.\nFinancial Information about Segments\nInformation about our reportable segments can be found in the MD&A and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNarrative Description of Business\nBusiness Model\n. Our business model is focused on delivering sustainable value creation by driving balanced top- and bottom-line growth. We create, manufacture, market and distribute a diversified portfolio of daily-use products to delight consumers with irresistible superiority across five key vectors - product performance, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value. We invest in research and development and consumer insights to invent new categories or products and innovate our existing products, ensuring they meet evolving consumer needs and preferences. We leverage marketing strategies including advertising, promotions and endorsements to drive brand awareness and loyalty among consumers. The Company utilizes various distribution channels, including retail stores, e-commerce platforms and direct-to-consumer platforms to deliver our products. Our business model relies on continued productivity improvements to fuel investments in R&D and marketing and deliver value creation. Our objective is to deliver sustainable and balanced top- and bottom-line growth while serving the needs of all stakeholders\u2009\u2014\u2009consumers, customers, employees, society and shareowners.\nKey Product Categories\n. Information on key product categories can be found in the MD&A and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nKey Customers\n. Our customers include mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. We also sell direct to consumers. Sales to Walmart Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 16% of our total sales in 2024 and 15% in 2023 and 2022. No other customer represents more than 10% of our total sales. Our top ten customers accounted for 42% of our total net sales in 2024, 40% in 2023 and 39% in 2022.\nSources and Availability of Materials\n. Almost all of the raw and packaging materials used by the Company are purchased from third parties, some of whom are single-source suppliers. We produce certain raw materials, primarily chemicals, for further use in the manufacturing process. In addition, fuel, natural gas and derivative products are important commodities consumed in our manufacturing processes and in the transportation of input materials and finished products. The prices we pay for materials and other commodities are subject to fluctuation. When prices for these items change, we may or may not pass the change to our customers. The Company purchases a substantial variety of other raw and packaging materials, none of which are material to our business taken as a whole.\nTrademarks and Patents\n. We own or have rights to patents and trademarks, which are used in connection with our activity in all businesses. Our patents cover a range of product features, including significant product formulation and processes used to manufacture our products. The trademarks are important to the overall marketing and branding of our products. In part, our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks and patents.\nCompetitive Condition\n. The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. Our products compete against similar products from a broad range of companies, both large and small, both established and new, including well-known global competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. In this highly competitive setting, we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. Our integrated strategy and our focus on driving superiority across product, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value are key differentiators in the marketplace.\n2 The Procter & Gamble Company\nGovernment Regulation\n. Our Company is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across the countries in which we do business. In the United States, many of our products and manufacturing operations are subject to one or more federal or state regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). We are also subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and antitrust and competition laws and regulations that govern our dealings with suppliers, customers, competitors and government officials.\nIn addition, many foreign jurisdictions in which we do business have regulations and regulatory bodies that govern similar aspects of our operations and products, in some cases to an even more significant degree. We are also subject to expanding laws and regulations related to environmental protection and other sustainability-related matters, non-financial reporting and diligence, labor and employment, trade, taxation and privacy and data protection, including the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation and similar regulations in states within the United States and in countries around the world.\nThe Company has in place compliance programs and internal and external experts to help guide our business in complying with these and other existing laws and regulations that apply to us around the globe; and we have made, and plan to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with these laws and regulations. We also expect that our many suppliers, consultants and other third parties working on our behalf share our commitment to compliance, and we have policies and procedures in place to manage these relationships, though they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over operations and governance. We do not expect that the Company\u2019s expenditures for compliance with current government regulations, including current environmental regulations, will have a material effect on our total capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position in fiscal year 2025 as compared to prior periods.\nHuman Capital\n. Our employees are a key source of competitive advantage. Their actions, guided by our Purpose, Values and Principles (PVPs), are critical to the long-term success of our business. We aim to retain our talented employees by offering competitive compensation and benefits, strong career development and a respectful and inclusive culture that provides equal opportunity for all.\nOur Board of Directors, through the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee (C&LD Committee), provides oversight of the Company\u2019s policies and strategy relating to talent, including equality and inclusion, as well as the Company\u2019s compensation principles and practices. The C&LD Committee also evaluates and approves the Company\u2019s compensation plans, policies and programs applicable to our senior executives.\nEmployees\nAs of June\u00a030, 2024, the Company had approximately 108,000 employees, unchanged versus the prior year. The total number of employees is an estimate of total Company employees excluding interns, co-ops, contractors and employees of joint ventures. 48% of our employees are in manufacturing roles and 28% of our employees are located in the United States. 42% of our global employees are women and 32% of our U.S. employees identify as multicultural.\nTraining and Development\nWe focus on attracting, developing and retaining the widest pool of talent available, both from universities and the broader market. We recruit from universities across markets in which we compete and are generally able to select from the top talent. We focus on developing our employees by providing a variety of job experiences, training programs and skill development opportunities. Given our develop-from-within model for staffing most of our senior leadership positions, it is particularly important for us to ensure holistic growth and full engagement of our employees.\nDiversity, Equality and Inclusion\nAs a consumer products company, we believe that it is important for our workforce to reflect the diversity of our consumers worldwide. We also seek to foster an inclusive work environment where each individual can bring their authentic self, which helps drive innovation and enables us to better serve our consumers. We aspire to achieve equal gender representation globally and at key management and leadership levels. Within the U.S. workforce, our aspiration is to achieve 40% multicultural representation overall as well as at management and leadership levels.\nCompensation and Benefits\nMarket-competitive compensation and reward programs are critical elements of our employee value equation to attract and retain the best talent. Our total rewards programs are based on the principles of paying for performance, paying competitively versus peer companies that we compete with for talent in the marketplace and focusing on long-term success through a combination of short-term and long-term incentive programs. We also offer competitive benefit programs, including retirement plans and health insurance, in line with local country practices, with flexibility to accommodate the needs of a diverse workforce.\nSustainability\n. Environmental sustainability is integrated into our business strategy. We are focused on designing and manufacturing irresistibly superior products that are more sustainable. We aim to reduce our own environmental footprint and enable our consumers to reduce their footprint without compromising on the performance of the products they use. We develop and license technologies that can be used across industries to improve environmental sustainability at a broader scale.\nThe Procter & Gamble Company 3\nCombined, this approach intends to positively impact the total environmental impact of the Company while driving market growth and value creation.\nIn 2021, the Company announced a 2040 net zero ambition. Our Climate Transition Action Plan outlines the Company\u2019s ongoing efforts toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions across scopes 1 and 2 and elements of scope 3. The Company has also declared objectives towards purchasing renewable electricity for our operations, reducing use of virgin petroleum-based plastic in packaging, increasing the recyclability or reusability of packaging, responsible sourcing of key forest-based commodities, improving efficiency of water usage in our operations and driving a global portfolio of water restoration projects that help address water scarcity in key water basins. Our progress towards these objectives may be influenced and impacted by various stakeholders and developments beyond our control.\nSustainability related disclosures included in this Annual Report, our Proxy Statement and our sustainability reports are informed by standards and guidelines such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The \u201cmateriality\u201d thresholds in those standards and guidelines may differ from the concept of \u201cmateriality\u201d for purposes of the federal securities laws and disclosures required by the Commission\u2019s rules in this Annual Report. References to our sustainability reports and website are for informational purposes only and neither the sustainability reports nor the other information on our website is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

  "Item 1A - Risk Factors": "Item 1A) of this Form 10-K.\nPurpose, Approach and Non-GAAP Measures\nThe purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&A is organized in the following sections:\n\u2022\nOverview\n\u2022\nSummary of 2024 Results\n\u2022\nEconomic Conditions and Uncertainties\n\u2022\nResults of Operations\n\u2022\nSegment Results\n\u2022\nCash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity\n\u2022\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\u2022\nOther Information\nThroughout the MD&A we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales, net earnings, diluted net earnings per common share (diluted EPS) and operating cash flow. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under U.S. GAAP, including organic sales growth, Core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the\nThe Procter & Gamble Company 15\ndefinition of these non-GAAP measures, details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.\nManagement also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures quarter and fiscal year-to-date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales. In our presentation of data in tables or other charts, certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding.\nOVERVIEW\nP&G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in about 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. We also sell direct to individual consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in about 70 countries.\nOur market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We believe we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.\nOrganizational Structure\nOur organizational structure is comprised of Sector Business Units (SBUs), Enterprise Markets (EMs), Corporate Functions (CF) and Global Business Services (GBS).\nSector Business Units\nThe Company's product categories are organized into five SBUs and five reportable segments (under U.S. GAAP): Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric & Home Care; and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. The SBUs are responsible for global brand strategy, product upgrades and innovation, marketing plans and supply chain. They have direct profit responsibility for markets (referred to as Focus Markets) representing the large majority of the Company's sales and earnings and are also responsible for innovation plans, supply plans and operating frameworks to drive growth and value creation in the remaining markets (referred to as Enterprise Markets). Throughout the MD&A, we reference business results by region, which are comprised of North America, Europe, Greater China, Latin America, Asia Pacific and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA).\n16 The Procter & Gamble Company\nThe following provides additional detail on our reportable segments and the product categories and brand composition within each segment.\nReportable Segments\n% of\nNet\u00a0Sales\n(1)\n% of Net\nEarnings\n(1)\nProduct Categories (Sub-Categories)\nMajor Brands\nBeauty\n18%\n18%\nHair Care (\nConditioners, Shampoos, Styling Aids, Treatments\n)\nHead & Shoulders, Herbal Essences, Pantene, Rejoice\nSkin and Personal Care (\nAntiperspirants and Deodorants, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care\n)\nOlay, Old Spice, Safeguard, Secret, SK-II, Native\nGrooming\n8%\n9%\nGrooming (\nAppliances, Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Grooming\n)\nBraun, Gillette, Venus\nHealth Care\n14%\n14%\nOral Care (\nToothbrushes, Toothpastes, Other Oral Care\n)\nCrest, Oral-B\nPersonal Health Care (\nGastrointestinal, Pain Relief, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Other Personal Health Care\n)\nMetamucil, Neurobion, Pepto-Bismol, Vicks\nFabric & Home Care\n36%\n34%\nFabric Care (\nFabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents\n)\nAriel, Downy, Gain, Tide\nHome Care (\nAir Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care\n)\nCascade, Dawn, Fairy, Febreze, Mr. Clean, Swiffer\nBaby, Feminine & Family Care\n24%\n25%\nBaby Care (\nBaby Wipes, Taped Diapers and Pants\n)\nLuvs, Pampers\nFeminine Care (\nAdult Incontinence, Menstrual Care\n)\nAlways, Always Discreet, Tampax\nFamily Care (\nPaper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper\n)\nBounty, Charmin, Puffs\n(1)\nPercent of Net sales and Net earnings for the fiscal year ended June\u00a030, 2024 (excluding results held in Corporate).\n\nOrganization Design:\nSector Business Units\nBeauty:\n We are a global market leader amongst the beauty categories in which we compete, including hair care and skin and personal care.

  "Item 1B - Unresolved Staff Comments": "Item 1B.\nUnresolved Staff Comments.\nNone.\nItem 1C.\nCybersecurity.\nRisk Management and Strategy\nThe Company employs multiple tools and processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. A multi-functional enterprise security team reviews and assesses top cybersecurity risks. This assessment is shared with members of senior management, including the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), and helps guide the Company's cybersecurity operational priorities and strategy. In addition, cybersecurity risks are integrated into the Company\u2019s broader Enterprise Risk Management program and, when identified, are reported to relevant business and governance leaders within the Company for appropriate action.\nTo support the ongoing identification and management of cybersecurity issues, the Company provides information security employee training, conducts global and targeted phishing simulation campaigns and conducts tabletop exercises. The Company also deploys a large library of security tools and experts to help prevent, detect, contain, eradicate and recover from potential cybersecurity issues and cyber-attacks. Further, the Company engages third-party consultants and services for cyber intelligence, insights and assessments of its cybersecurity risk posture and governance.\nCybersecurity reviews are embedded into the Company\u2019s Third-Party Risk Management program. Generally under this program, third parties that process personal data or high-risk business data on behalf of the Company complete privacy and cybersecurity assessments on a risk basis, which may require such third parties to sign data processing agreements, comply with particular security controls or complete an additional security and privacy assessment.\nAs a global company, we manage a variety of cybersecurity threats and cannot wholly eliminate the risk of adverse impacts from such incidents. However, as of the date of this Form 10-K, we have not identified any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results of our operations or financial condition. For additional information on the risks from cybersecurity threats that we have faced in the past and expect to continue to face in the future, please refer to the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part I,",
