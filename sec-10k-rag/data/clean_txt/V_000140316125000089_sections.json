  "Item 1 - Business": "Item 1\u2014Competition\n above.\nOur competitors may acquire, develop or make better use of substantially better technology, have more widely adopted delivery channels, or have greater financial resources. They may offer more effective, innovative or a wider range of programs, products and services. They may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies that result in broader brand recognition and greater use, including with respect to issuance and seller acceptance. They may also develop better solutions or offer more favorable pricing. Moreover, even if we successfully adapt to technological change and the proliferation of alternative types of payment services by developing and offering our own services in these areas, such services may provide less favorable financial terms for us, which could hurt our financial results. We expect to face more competition as AI continues to advance and GenAI and agentic AI capabilities become integrated into payments and related services in two main ways: first, by competitors successfully enhancing their products, services and external offerings with AI to achieve greater and faster product adoption; and second, by competitors providing internal AI tools to upskill their employees for greater operational efficiencies and impact. In addition, our competitors may have, or in the future may obtain, proprietary rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to design, use or sell our own AI-based offerings or services to our clients and other third parties. If we do not continue to invest in developing and supporting our AI-based initiatives, we may fall behind technological developments and evolving industry standards, which would likewise harm our reputation and ability to effectively compete, retain clients or grow our business.\nCertain of our competitors operate with different business models, have different cost structures or participate in different market segments. Many of these competitors are also able to use existing payment networks without being subject to many of the associated costs. Moreover, these competitors also occupy various roles in the payments ecosystem that enable them to influence payment choice of other participants. Some of our competitors, including American Express, Discover, private-label card networks, virtual currency providers, technology companies that enable the exchange of digital assets, and certain alternative payments systems like Alipay and WeChat Pay, operate closed-loop payments systems, with direct connections to both sellers and consumers. Those business models may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to regulatory, technological and other developments. In some cases, these competitors have the support of government mandates that prohibit, limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for transactions within certain countries and regions. For more information on government actions, initiatives or regulations that could impact competition, please see",
  "Item 8 - Financial Statements": "Item 8\n of this report. If successful, these efforts could adversely impact consumers\u2019 usage of our products and decrease our overall payments volume and net revenue, lead to regulatory enforcement and/or litigation that increases our compliance and litigation expenses, and ultimately harm our business.\nWe depend on relationships with financial institutions, acquirers, processors, sellers, payment facilitators, ecommerce platforms, fintechs and other third parties.\nOur relationships with industry participants are complex and require us to balance the interests of multiple third parties. For instance, we depend significantly on relationships with our financial institution clients and on their relationships with account holders and sellers to provide our products and services, and thereby compete effectively in the marketplace. We offer incentives to sellers, acquirers, ecommerce platforms and processors to encourage routing preference and acceptance growth. We also engage in many payment card co-branding efforts with sellers, who receive incentives from us. As emerging participants such as fintechs enter the payments industry, we engage in discussions to address the role they may play in the ecosystem, whether as, for example, an issuer, seller, ecommerce platform or digital wallet provider. As these and other relationships become more prevalent and take on a greater importance to our business, our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationships. In addition, we depend on our clients and third parties, including network partners, vendors and suppliers, to submit, facilitate and process transactions properly, provide various services associated with our payments network on our behalf, and otherwise adhere to our operating rules and applicable laws. As our clients expand their global footprint, their legal and regulatory obligations can become even more complex. From time to time, our relationships may be affected by actions of our clients and industry participants that may materially and adversely impact our business, products or services, and to the extent we or such parties fail to perform or deliver\n29\nTable\nof Contents\nadequate services or comply with regulatory obligations, it may result in negative experiences for account holders or others when using their Visa-branded payment products, which could harm our business and reputation.\nOur business could be harmed if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, if events occur that have the potential to damage our brand or reputation, or if we experience brand disintermediation.\nOur brand is globally recognized and is a key asset of our business. We believe that our clients and their account holders associate our brand with acceptance, security, convenience, speed and reliability. Our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the value of our brand and reputation of our products and services in the payments ecosystem, elevate the brand through new and existing products, services and partnerships, and uphold our corporate reputation. The popularity of products that we have developed in partnership with technology companies and financial institutions as well as government actions that mandate other networks to process Visa-branded card transactions may have the potential to cause brand disintermediation at the point of sale, in ecommerce and mobile channels, and decrease the presence of our brand. Our brand reputation may also be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including authorization, clearing and settlement service disruptions; data security breaches; compliance failures by Visa, including by our employees, agents, clients, partners or suppliers; failure to meet expectations of our clients, consumers or other stakeholders; negative perception of our industry, the industries of our clients, Visa-accepting sellers, or our clients\u2019 customers and agents, including third-party payments providers; ill-perceived actions or affiliations by clients, partners or other third parties, such as sponsorship or co-brand partners; and fraudulent, or illegal activities using our payment products or services, and which we may not always be in a position to detect and/or prevent from occurring over our network. Our brand could also be negatively impacted when our products are used to facilitate payment for legal, but controversial, products and services, including adult content, firearms and gambling activities. Additionally, these risks could be exacerbated if our financial institution partners and/or sellers fail to maintain necessary controls to ensure the legality of these transactions, if any legal liability associated with such goods or services is extended to ancillary participants in the value chain like payments networks, or if our network and industry become entangled in political or social debates concerning such legal, but controversial, commerce. If we are unable to maintain our reputation, the value of our brand may be impaired, which could harm our relationships with clients, account holders, employees, prospective employees, governments and the public, as well as impact our business.\nGlobal economic, political, market, health and social events or conditions may harm our business.\nMore than half of our net revenue is earned outside the U.S. In addition, international cross-border transaction revenue represents a significant part of our net revenue and is an important part of our growth strategy. Our net revenue is dependent on the volume and number of payment transactions made by consumers, governments, and businesses whose spending patterns may be affected by economic, political, market, health and social events or conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions within the U.S. or internationally, including but not limited to recessions, inflation, rising interest rates, increase in tariff rates, high unemployment, currency fluctuations, actual or anticipated large-scale defaults or failures, rising energy prices, a slowdown or disruption of global trade, trade retaliation, government shutdowns, and reduced consumer, small business, government, and corporate spending, have a direct impact on international commerce. Our business depends on the smooth functioning of international financial systems and the free flow of commerce across borders. Any restrictions on the activities of multinational businesses, disruptions to global trade, or deterioration in internat",
  "Item 1A - Risk Factors": "Item 1A\u2014Regulatory Risks\n above.\nWe expect the competitive landscape to continue to shift and evolve. For example:\n\u2022\nWe, along with our competitors, clients, network participants, and others are developing or participating in alternative payments systems or products, such as mobile payment services, ecommerce payment services, P2P payment services, real-time and faster payment initiatives, and payment services that permit\n27\nTable\nof Contents\nACH or direct debits from or to consumer checking accounts, that could either reduce our role or otherwise disintermediate us from the transaction processing or the value-added services we provide to support such processing. Examples include initiatives from The Clearing House, an association consisting of large financial institutions that has developed its own faster payments system; Early Warning Services, which operates Zelle, a bank-offered alternative network that provides another platform for faster funds or real-time payments across a variety of payment types, including P2P, corporate and government disbursement, bill pay and deposit check transactions; and cryptocurrency, including stablecoin-based payments initiatives.\n\u2022\nIn July 2025, the U.S. enacted the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act), establishing a comprehensive framework for regulating stablecoins. Similarly, the European Union has adopted its own legal framework for crypto assets. Many other countries, including the U.K., Japan, United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong and Singapore, are at varying stages of adopting stablecoin and digital assets-related regulatory frameworks. With more regulatory certainty and permissive or favorable regulations, stablecoins could potentially disrupt existing payment networks, including in cross-border and B2B transactions. In countries facing currency instability and controls, stablecoins could increasingly be used as an alternative to preserve and transfer asset value. In more mature markets, stablecoins could achieve broad adoption through regulated issuance by traditional banks, fintechs and other new entrants, as well as by being integrated in closed loop systems operated by large digital ecosystems and platforms.\n\u2022\nParties that access our payment credentials, tokens and technologies, including clients, technology solution providers or others might be able to migrate or steer account holders and other clients to alternative payment methods or use our payment credentials, tokens and technologies to establish or help bolster alternate payment methods and platforms.\n\u2022\nParticipants in the payments industry may merge, form joint ventures or enable or enter into other business combinations or bilateral agreements that strengthen their existing business propositions or create new, competing payment services. For example, parties may agree not to use our payments network for processing transactions resulting in sellers processing transactions directly with issuers, or processors processing transactions directly with issuers and acquirers.\n\u2022\nNew or revised industry standards for or related to payments set by individual countries, regions or standard setting organizations may result in additional costs and expenses for Visa and its clients, or otherwise negatively impact the functionality and competitiveness of our products and services.\nAs the competitive landscape is quickly evolving, we may not be able to foresee or respond sufficiently to emerging risks associated with new businesses, products, services and practices. We may be asked to adjust our local rules and practices, develop or customize certain aspects of our payment services, adjust the economics or pricing for our offerings, or agree to business arrangements that may be less protective of Visa\u2019s proprietary technology and interests in order to compete and we may face increasing operational costs and risk of litigation concerning intellectual property. Our failure to compete effectively in light of any such developments could harm our business and prospects for future growth.\nOur net revenue and profits are dependent on our client and seller base, which may be costly to win, retain and develop.\nOur financial institution clients and sellers can reassess their commitments to us at any time or develop their own competitive services. While we have certain contractual protections, our clients, including some of our largest clients, generally have flexibility to issue non-Visa products. In certain circumstances, our financial institution clients may decide to terminate our contractual relationship on relatively short notice without paying significant early termination fees. Because a significant portion of our net revenue is concentrated among our largest clients, the loss of business from any one of these larger clients could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
