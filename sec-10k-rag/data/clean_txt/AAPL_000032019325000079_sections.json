An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\u2019s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company\u2019s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks.\nMacroeconomic Conditions\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 21\nTariffs and Other Measures\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, new U.S. Tariffs were announced, including additional tariffs on imports from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the EU, among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S. Tariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs or other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other measures that are applied to the Company\u2019s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company\u2019s supply chain, the availability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains uncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the overall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment for the Company\u2019s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nSegment Operating Performance\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2025, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):\n2025\nChange\n2024\nChange\n2023\nAmericas\n$\n178,353\u00a0\n7\u00a0\n%\n$\n167,045\u00a0\n3\u00a0\n%\n$\n162,560\u00a0\nEurope\n111,032\u00a0\n10\u00a0\n%\n101,328\u00a0\n7\u00a0\n%\n94,294\u00a0\nGreater China\n64,377\u00a0\n(4)\n%\n66,952\u00a0\n(8)\n%\n72,559\u00a0\nJapan\n28,703\u00a0\n15\u00a0\n%\n25,052\u00a0\n3\u00a0\n%\n24,257\u00a0\nRest of Asia Pacific\n33,696\u00a0\n10\u00a0\n%\n30,658\u00a0\n4\u00a0\n%\n29,615\u00a0\nTotal net sales\n$\n416,161\u00a0\n6\u00a0\n%\n$\n391,035\u00a0\n2\u00a0\n%\n$\n383,285\u00a0\nAmericas\nAmericas net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

The Company\u2019s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia, New Zealand and those Asian countries not included in the Company\u2019s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company\u2019s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.\nMarkets and Distribution\nThe Company\u2019s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company sells its services in the same markets through its various service platforms. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers and other resellers, for the sale of its products and certain of its services. During 2025, the Company\u2019s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 40% and 60%, respectively, of total net sales.\nCompetition\nThe markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and are characterized by aggressive price competition, downward pressure on gross margins, continual improvement in product performance, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. The markets in which the Company competes are further defined by frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, and rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on its intellectual property.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 2\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design and technology innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, corporate reputation, and the ability to effectively protect and enforce the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights.\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company\u2019s products and services face substantial competition from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products to offer more competitive solutions. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. Some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broad product lines, low-priced products, large installed bases of active devices, and large customer bases. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer, tablet and wearables markets, and some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. Restrictions on international trade can increase the cost or limit the availability of the Company\u2019s products and the components and rare earths and other raw materials that go into them.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, the Company may not be able to extend or renew agreements for the supply of components on similar terms, or at all, and may not be successful in obtaining sufficient quantities from its suppliers or in a timely manner, or in identifying and obtaining sufficient quantities from an alternative source. In addition, component suppliers may fail, be subject to consolidation within a particular industry, or decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its hardware, software and service research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company\u2019s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 3\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company\u2019s products and services include technology or intellectual property that must be licensed from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company\u2019s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company\u2019s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches.

  "Item 3 - Legal Proceedings": "Item 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Legal Proceedings\nDigital Markets Act Investigations\nOn March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened a formal noncompliance investigation against the Company under Article 5(4) of the EU DMA (\u201cArticle 5(4) Investigation\u201d). The Article 5(4) Investigation relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store, as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened an additional formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the Company\u2019s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA (\u201cArticle 6(4) Investigation\u201d). On April 23, 2025, the Commission fined the Company \u20ac500 million in the Article 5(4) Investigation and issued a cease and desist order requiring the Company to remove technical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to alternative distribution channels outside the App Store. The Company has appealed the Commission\u2019s Article 5(4) decision. Also on April 23, 2025, the Commission issued preliminary findings in the Article 6(4) Investigation. If the Commission makes a final determination in the Article 6(4) Investigation that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company\u2019s annual worldwide net sales. The Commission may also seek to impose additional fines if it deems that the Company has violated a cease and desist order. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\nOn March 21, 2024, the DOJ and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for \u201cperformance smartphones\u201d and \u201csmartphones\u201d in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition,\nvarious civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S.\n alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (\u201cCalifornia District Court\u201d) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California\u2019s unfair competition law based upon the Company\u2019s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company\u2019s App Review Guidelines violate California\u2019s unfair competition law and issued an injunction (the \u201c2021 Injunction\u201d) enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than the Company\u2019s in-app purchase system. The 2021 Injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefronts of the iOS and iPadOS App Stores. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the 2021 Injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a motion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate the 2021 Injunction. On April 30, 2025, the California District Court found the Company to be in violation of the 2021 Injunction and enjoined the Company from imposing any commission or any fee on purchases that consumers make outside an app; restricting, conditioning, limiting, or prohibiting how developers guide consumers to purchases outside an app; or otherwise interfering with a consumer\u2019s choice to proceed in or out of an app. The California District Court also denied the Company\u2019s motion to narrow or vacate the 2021 Injunction and referred the Company to the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California for a determination whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate. The Company will continue to vigorously defend its actions and employees, and has appealed the California District Court\u2019s most recent decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (\u201cNinth Circuit Court\u201d). Although the Company\u2019s request to stay the decision pending appeal was denied, the Ninth Circuit Court has agreed to consider the Company\u2019s appeal on an expedited basis, with oral arguments heard in October 2025.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2025 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.",
  "Item 7A - Market Risk": "Item 7A.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company\u2019s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate\u2013sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any associated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September\u00a027, 2025 and September\u00a028, 2024 (dollars in millions):\nInterest Rate\nSensitive Instrument\nHypothetical Interest\nRate Increase\nPotential Impact\n2025\n2024\nInvestment portfolio\n100 basis points, all tenors\nDecline in fair value\n$\n2,416\u00a0\n$\n2,755\u00a0\nTerm debt\n100 basis points, all tenors\nIncrease in annual interest expense\n$\n129\u00a0\n$\n139\u00a0\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\u2019s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $590 million and $538 million as of September\u00a027, 2025 and September\u00a028, 2024, respectively. Changes in the Company\u2019s underlying foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivatives.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 27"
