We do this using a multi-layered safety and security strategy:\n\u2022\nThe\n\u201cPrevent\u201d\n layer is designed to protect against attacks on infrastructure, devices and data. We have continued to grow global usage of EMV chip and contactless security technology, helping to reduce fraud. Our solutions include Mastercard SafetyNet\u2122, which protects financial institutions by helping to stop real-time attacks that are visible in the network, but not easily detected by financial institutions.\nKey 2022 Developments\n\u2022\nIn 2022, we significantly extended the reach of our Consumer Clarity services, enhancing the value of payments by providing cardholders with merchant details and digital receipts to reduce disputes, lower chargeback costs and improve the consumer experience.\n\u2022\nThe\n\u201cIdentify\u201d\n layer allows us to help banks and merchants verify the authenticity of consumers during the payment process using various biometric technologies, including fingerprint, face and iris scanning, and behavioral user data assessment technology to verify online purchases on mobile devices, as well as a card with biometric technology built in.\n\u2022\nThe\n\u201cDetect\u201d\n layer spots fraudulent behavior and cyber-attacks and takes action to stop these activities once detected.

Our offerings in this space include solutions for consumer alerts and controls and a suite of digital token services. We also offer an e-commerce fraud and dispute management network that enables merchants to stop delivery when a fraudulent or disputed transaction is identified, and issuers to refund the cardholder to avoid the chargeback process.\n\u2022\nThe\n\u201cNetwork\u201d\n layer extends the services we provide to transactions in the payments ecosystem and across all of our rails, including decision intelligence and tokenization capabilities, to help secure our customers and transactions on a r",
